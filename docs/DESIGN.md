# Design Document

## Principles

**Data outlives pipelines.** Extraction logic will be refactored, replaced, or deprecated while the data remains valuable. Infrastructure lifecycle should not dictate data lifecycle.

**Pipelines are standalone.** Each pipeline is deployed independently without impacting others. Isolated blast radius, simple reasoning.
